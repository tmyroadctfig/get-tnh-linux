How to compile?
    To compile the program, you need the C++ compile (g++). At the top level directory of source code, type
        make
    to start the compilation. If it prompt you about missing library, please install them.
    After the compile done, a single executable file (get_tnh) will generate, type
        ./get_tnh --help
    to read the usage detail.

Cross-compile
    If you want to cross-compile, you need to edit the makefile at the top level directory of the source.
    Change the line
        CROSS_COMPILE=0
    to
        CROSS_COMPILE=1
    then modify the line
        CROSS=/opt/arm-gcc-4.6.3-glibc-2.14.1-s3c6410/bin/arm-s3c6410-linux-gnueabi-
    to match the cross-compiler you are using.
    After that, type "make" to start the build.
